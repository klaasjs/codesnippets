# Visual Studio Code snippets
This is a set of Javascript / Typescript [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) snippets I use every day.

It targets AngularJS / NodeJS and Express. The snippets for NodeJS / Express are in javascript. The AngularJS snippets are in TypeScript.

## Installation
Move to your VSCode snippets path. Usually this is: \Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Code\User\Snippets.

```
git clone https://github.com/klaasjs/codesnippets.git
```

And make it yours:
```
rm -rf .git
```

Enjoy!
